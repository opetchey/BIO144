Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It provides tools to summarize large datasets and draw meaningful conclusions. Key concepts in basic statistics include measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode, which describe the center of a dataset. Measures of variability, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, indicate the spread of the data. Probability forms the foundation for inferential statistics, enabling predictions and hypothesis testing. Common applications include calculating percentages, understanding trends, and making data-driven decisions in fields like science, business, and social studies.
